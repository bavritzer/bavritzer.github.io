  <h1>Instructions</h1>
  <p>Step 1: Plug the theremin into any power outlet while your hand is over the sensor tube.<br>
<br>
      Step 2: The theremin detects light from its antenna. Blocking out different amounts of light results in a different note being played. After plugging it in, move your hand up and down to define the max and min height for playing notes. You can also use different hand positions which let through different amounts of sunlight for the same effect.<br>
<br>
      Step 3: When the theremin starts playing, play away! <br>
      <br>Step 4: Connect the theremin to your computer using Bluetooth to unlock additional functions, including the <a href="https://bavritzer.github.io/tutorial.html">Interactive Tutorial</a>, <a href="https://bavritzer.github.io/songbook.html">Songbook</a>, and a wider range.
